# Madame Gwen's Tarot
*a web app for your future*

## Description
Currently in the early stages of development, this web app is designed to let users without access to a tarot deck practice for free. Upon load, the user will be given
the option to do a one, three, or five card draw. The cards will then be "dealt" with their names, description, and corresponding meaning. Each type of draw will have
general instructions as to how to read the spread, and extra information about card meanings are available in the menu.
